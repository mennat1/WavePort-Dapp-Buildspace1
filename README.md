# Simple Wave Portal Dapp (Buildspace First Project)
![This is an image for the dapp UI](./dappUI.png)

## Brief:
- I used Hardhat, ethers.js and deployed on Rinkeby Testnet.
- This dapp lets you connect via metamask to send a message and have a 50% chance to win 0.001 ether.
- It keeps track of all received messages and render their sender address, timestamp, and text.

## To do:
- Use chainlink VRF to generate the random seed.
